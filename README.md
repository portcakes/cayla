# Hey, I’m Cayla 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer and product builder who loves turning messy ideas into real, shippable software.

I design and ship end-to-end SaaS tools with a focus on practical AI, automation, and systems thinking — usually working across the entire stack from database architecture to frontend UX.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of:
	•	🧠 AI-assisted tools
	•	⚙️ operations & workflow automation
	•	📦 small business / creator software
	•	🚀 early-stage startup building
